Running back Eddie George juggled a pass, allowing Lewis an opening to rip the ball from him and run 50 yards for his first career touchdown. It was the defining play of a dominant defense that went on to win a Super Bowl.","playVideo": "http://www.nfl.com/videos/baltimore-ravens/0ap2000000120992/Eddie-George-We-didn-t-like-each-other-on-the-field","videoBool": "TRUE"},{"playName": "Shannon Sharpe's 96-yard breakaway score","playDate": "Jan. 14, 2001","playText": "As Sharpe later explained, the Ravens were merely trying to distance themselves from their end zone to set up a more comfortable punt. Trent Dilfer's pass to Sharpe appeared to do that until the Raiders whiffed on the tackle and Sharpe booked it for a 96-yard touchdown. Those were the only points the Ravens would need in a 16-3 AFC Championship game road win that paved the way to their first Super Bowl.","playVideo": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SskQc3b7ZS0","videoBool": "TRUE"},{"playName": "Jermaine Lewis brings down Giants","playDate": "Jan. 28, 2001","playText": "The Ravens dominated much of Super Bowl XXXV, extending their lead to 17-0 in the third quarter on an interception return for a touchdown. But the Giants responded by returning the ensuing kickoff for a TD. Suddenly they had a spark. Until Lewis took it away with his own return for a TD. \"That stuck a little dagger in them,\" Lewis said. \"I knew it was over at that point. No. 84 gained 84 yards on his kickoff return for a touchdown and then pointed to the sky to honor the son he and his wife lost the previous month.","playVideo": "https://www.facebook.com/NFL/videos/10153604656346263/","videoBool": "TRUE"},{"playName": "McAlister's 107-yard field goal return","playDate": "Sept. 30, 2002","playText": "At the end of the first half in a game against Denver, Broncos kicker Elam's long field goal attempt veered way wide, and McAlister caught it seven yards deep in the end zone. He moseyed around -- appearing like he'd eventually take a knee to end the half. But McAlister was really allowing his blockers to form a wall. Once they did, he shot out of the end zone and bolted up field with the help of a huge block by Ray Lewis. \"That's how we practice it,\" said McAlister, who ran 107 yards for what was, at the time, the longest play in NFL history.","playVideo": "","videoBool": "FALSE"},{"playName": "Flacco the pass-catcher","playDate": "Oct. 26, 2008","playText": "Joe Flacco leads the Ravens in just about every career passing category, but he also has a 43-yard reception to his name. During his rookie season, Flacco caught a pass from backup Troy Smith on a trick play and nearly scored a touchdown before stumbling five yards shy of the end zone. \"I trusted myself that if they threw it, I would catch it,\" Flacco said. â€¦ \"I was hoping I would catch it. I didn't want to make a fool of myself.\" You did all right, Joe.","playVideo": "http://www.baltimoreravens.com/videos/videos/Troy-Smith-to-Joe-Flacco/B8E91A6B-765A-4F55-B733-6FCF7753CE73","videoBool": "TRUE"},{"playName": "Reed laterals to Landry","playDate": "Nov. 21, 2010","playText": "Ed Reed's oeuvre also includes 106- and 108-yard interception returns, but we like this play for its oozing audaciousness. Reed's interception of Panthers quarterback Brian St. Pierre pretty much clinched a road win but, wait -- what the heck is he doing? Not content with allowing his Ravens to squeeze out the clock, Reed, on the move, lateraled the ball to a sprinting Dawan Landry, who ran 20-plus yards for the touchdown. Ray Lewis returned an interception for a touchdown on the next play from scrimmage.","playVideo": "","videoBool": "FALSE"},{"playName": "Ray Rice's 4th-and-29","playDate": "Nov. 25, 2012","playText": "The Ravens' second Super Bowl might never happen if not for an improbable 4th-and-29 conversion in Week 12. Facing a loss against the Chargers, quarterback Joe Flacco dumped the ball off to Rice who ran, cut, swerved and dove his way to the exact 29 yards he needed to extend the game-tying drive. The Ravens would win in overtime, and despite losing their next three games, they advanced to the playoffs at 10-6.","playVideo": "http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/0ap2000000100752/WK-12-Can-t-Miss-Play-Resilient-Rice-s-fourth-down-conversion","videoBool": "TRUE"},{"playName": "Mile High Miracle","playDate": "Jan. 12, 2013","playText": "The Ravens trailed by seven, 70 yards away from the end zone with less than a minute remaining. Their season was about to end  in Denver, until Joe Flacco and Jacoby Jones took advantage of a miscue in the Broncos' secondary. Flacco connected for a 70-yard pass to Jones, who scored the game-tying touchdown with 41 seconds remaining in regulation. The ball traveled about 55 yards in the air, and Jones ran the rest of the way down the sideline. The Ravens went on to win 38-35 in double overtime, and won two more games to capture their second Super Bowl.","playVideo": "http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/0ap2000000125460/Divisional-Can-t-Miss-Play-Jacoby-Jones-70-yard-TD-catch","videoBool": "TRUE"},{"playName": "Jacoby Jones lights up Super Bowl","playDate": "Feb. 3, 2013","playText": "Leading 21-6 coming out of the halftime break (thanks in part to a 56-yard touchdown catch from Jones in the second quarter) the Ravens speedster continued his magical playoff run with a record-breaking return. His 108-yard kickoff bringback was the longest in Super Bowl history and appeared to break the game open. After a bizarre power outage, the 49ers rallied to get within two points, but Baltimore hung on. The unlikely star of the playoffs, Jones performed on Dancing with the Stars in the ensuing offseason.","playVideo": "http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/0ap2000000135279/Can-t-Miss-Play-Jacoby-Jones-sets-record-with-kickoff-return","videoBool": "TRUE"},{"playName": "Kick Six in Cleveland","playDate": "Nov. 30, 2015","playText": "The Ravens' 2015 season isn't particularly memorable, but this play won't soon be forgotten.

In his first NFL game, 6-foot-7 defensive end Brent Urban blocked the kick. Will Hill scooped it up and ran more than 60 yards down the sideline for the win. \"It was one of the great football games you're ever going to see in terms of excitement,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said.","playVideo": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBkjOrYv1Gk","videoBool": "TRUE"}]
